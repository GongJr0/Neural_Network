# Neural Network With Python

This neural network is an extension of a [tutorial](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) with added loss and activation functions. Unlike the original tutorial project, this project was formatted to be package.

This network is not made to be used in projects, this is a personal project to understand the operation of neural networks by creating a primitive implementation.
